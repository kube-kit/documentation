# Importing a Cluster

Importing an existing kubernetes cluster from anywhere to kubekit is very simple.

To initiate the importing process, Navigate to the Import Cluster Page by clicking the **`Import Cluster`** button. Then follow the below steps:

1. **Provide Cluster Details**

   * On the left panel, select an icon, provide a name for your cluster and this will appear in the dashboard after importing. 

3. **Select Import Method**
    KubeKit provides three options for importing:
   - [Using Kubeconfig file](/docs/cluster/importing/by-kubeconfig.md#option-1)
   - [Using Kubeconfig content](/docs/cluster/importing/by-kubeconfig.md#option-2)
   - [Using master node](/docs/cluster/importing/by-credentials.md)

4. **Import the Cluster**

   * Click `Continue` to start the importing process.

**Congratulations!!** You have successfully imported your Kubernetes cluster using KubeKit!
