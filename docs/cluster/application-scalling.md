### Scaling Deployments

Scaling deployments in **KubeKit** is simple and quick. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Deployments** page under the **Workload** section in the sidebar.  
2. View all deployments across namespaces, or select a specific namespace from the dropdown at the top-left corner.  
3. Click the three-dot menu beside the desired deployment.  
4. Choose the **Scale** option.  
5. In the pop-up window, enter the desired number of replicas. The current replica count will be shown for reference.  
6. Click **Apply** to confirm. KubeKit will update the deployment and adjust the ReplicaSets accordingly.
