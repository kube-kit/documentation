# Creating a Cluster

Creating a Kubernetes cluster with KubeKit is designed to be simple, visual, and intuitive. Even users with minimal Kubernetes experience can understand and prepare for cluster creation.


## Cluster Creation Steps

The cluster creation workflow in KubeKit follows a clear step-by-step process:

1. **Initiate Cluster Creation**: Click the `Create Cluster` button on your KubeKit home page.
2. **Information Page**: Read through the introductory information and instructions.
3. **Node Input Page**: Enter the details for your VMs, including IP addresses and SSH credentials.
4. **Node Information Page**: Confirm that KubeKit can access the nodes and validate system requirements.
5. **Node Check**: KubeKit will verify connectivity, OS compatibility, and available resources.
6. **Cluster Configuration Page**: Configure Kubernetes version, container runtime, networking, and additional options.
7. **Create Cluster**: Once all settings are confirmed, initiate cluster creation. KubeKit will deploy all nodes and configure the cluster.
