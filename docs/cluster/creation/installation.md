# Installation

The **Installation** stage is the final step of setting up a cluster in KubeKit. This process is divided into four major phases:

1. **Installing Prerequisites**  
   KubeKit prepares all required dependencies and components for your cluster.

2. **Master Node Setup**  
   The control plane node is initialized and configured.

3. **Worker Node Setup**  
   Worker nodes are joined and prepared to run workloads.

4. **Finalizing Cluster**  
   KubeKit completes the setup and installs the selected add-ons during this phase.

Once these steps are completed, your cluster will be fully provisioned and ready for use.
