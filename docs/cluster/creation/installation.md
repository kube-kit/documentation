# Installation

**Great!!** Your cluster is building now

![Installation](/docs/images/final/installation.png)

Cluster setup time depends on your **cpu**, **memory** and **node internet speed**.

If any error occurs (often due to network issues):

* The process will stop.
* A **`Retry`** button will appear.
* Click **`Retry`** to continue from where it stopped.
* You can also track the error logs.

**Congratulations!!** You have successfully created your first Kubernetes cluster using KubeKit!
