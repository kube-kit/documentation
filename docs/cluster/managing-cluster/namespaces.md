# **Namespaces**

This section displays all namespaces within your cluster, giving you a clear overview of how workloads and resources are organized. Each namespace entry includes key details such as its **status**, **labels**, and **age**, allowing you to quickly assess its purpose and health. You can see more detail about the namespace by simply clicking on it.

You can search for a specific namespace or apply status-based filters to narrow down the list and focus on the namespaces that matter.  
If a namespace is no longer required, you can remove it easily using the **delete icon** available on the right side of each row.
