It lets you define, install, and upgrade applications using pre-configured templates known as releases. Each release includes all the configuration and dependencies needed to run an application seamlessly within a cluster. In simple terms, Helm allows you to deploy applications on Kubernetes without manually handling complex YAML configuration files. Common applications like NGINX, Prometheus, and Grafana can be deployed easily using Helm. KubeKit enhances this experience by providing a graphical interface for Helm operations, eliminating the need for command-line commands. With just a few clicks, you can browse, configure, and install applications directly into your clusters. Before You Begin Before using Helm in KubeKit, ensure: You have at least one running cluster connected to KubeKit. Internet access is available to fetch Helm repositories and releases. Necessary permissions are configured to install applications on the target cluster. Accessing Helm in KubeKit Open the KubeKit Dashboard. From the left-hand menu, select Helm. The Helm page will display a list of available Helm releases. Loading time may vary depending on your internet connection and the number of repositories added. Browsing Helm Releases On the Helm page: The left panel shows all available releases. Each release card displays: Name of the release Repository it belongs to Short description of its function Selecting a release displays detailed information on the right panel, including: Available versions Full description and configurations Option to choose a version for installation Installing a Release Select a release from the list. Click Install to open the Release Installation Page. On this page, you can: Select a version of the release. Choose a namespace for deployment. Provide a custom name to identify the release later. Configuring Release Values In the right panel, you can view and modify the release’s configuration values. These values define the application’s behavior and resource usage. You can: Edit values directly. Search for specific parameters. Add or delete configuration entries. Reset to default values. Note: Configuration options vary between releases. Some applications have only a few settings, while others offer extensive customization. Once configuration is complete, click Install. KubeKit handles the deployment and will notify you when the installation finishes. Managing Installed Releases Click the Installed tab to view all deployed releases. You can filter releases by namespace or search by name. Selecting a release shows its details on the right panel: Custom name (if assigned) Release name and version Namespace App version and last updated time Current status (Deployed, Failed, Uninstalled, etc.) You can also view all associated Kubernetes resources, such as: ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding – define access permissions. ConfigMap – store configuration data. Deployment – manage stateless applications. StatefulSet – manage stateful workloads. DaemonSet – ensure pods run on specific nodes. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) – manage storage requests. Service – expose applications internally or externally. ServiceAccount – provide identities for pods. Viewing these components helps in understanding and troubleshooting the deployed release. Managing Release Lifecycle After installation, you can perform the following lifecycle actions on any release: Upgrade Upgrade a release to: Change its version Update configuration values Reuse current release values during upgrades Example: If you installed Prometheus and changed the scrape_interval from 1 minute to 30 seconds, enabling Reuse current release values keeps that configuration during upgrade. Rollback Each installation or upgrade creates a revision, a checkpoint of your release. You can roll back to any previous revision to restore the application’s last working state in case of issues. Uninstall Uninstalling removes the release from the cluster. By default, KubeKit keeps the release history for future rollbacks. You can uncheck Keep history for future rollback if you want to permanently delete it. Managing Repositories Helm’s ecosystem includes thousands of prebuilt releases organized within repositories. A Helm repository is a collection of application charts maintained by different providers. Viewing and Managing Repositories Go to Helm → Manage Repo. The repository management page shows: Repository name and URL Category Status (Added or Not Added) Popular repositories may appear as Not Added by default. You can: Click the ⋮ (three dots) menu next to a repository. Choose Add to include it or Remove to delete it. To update repositories, use: Update All to refresh every repository. Update to refresh an individual one. Updating ensures the latest versions of releases are available. Adding a Custom Repository Click Add New Repository. Enter a custom name and the repository URL. Click Add to save. Your new repository will appear in the list, and its releases will load into the main Helm page.

It acts as a set of routing rules that determine which service should handle requests based on: Domain name (e.g., api.example.com) URL path (e.g., example.com/app) Ingress can also manage HTTPS/TLS certificates to secure communication. For detailed official documentation, refer to the Kubernetes Ingress page: Kubernetes Ingress Documentation Ingress Controller An Ingress Controller is the software that enforces Ingress rules. It runs inside the cluster and functions as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Its responsibilities include: Continuously watching Ingress resources Updating its configuration to ensure traffic is routed correctly Handling SSL/TLS termination Without an Ingress Controller, Ingress rules do not have any effect. Popular Ingress Controllers NGINX Ingress Controller Based on the NGINX web server Reliable, widely used, and production-ready Supports routing, SSL/TLS termination, and load balancing Official documentation: NGINX Ingress Controller Traefik Ingress Controller Modern, cloud-native proxy Developer-friendly and simple to configure Features automatic HTTPS and a built-in dashboard Official documentation: Traefik Ingress Controller Using Ingress in KubeKit When creating a cluster through KubeKit, you can enable an Ingress Controller: Choose an Ingress Controller: Select either NGINX or Traefik. Provide an external IP: This IP will be used for routing traffic. Once configured, your cluster is ready to route external traffic through the Ingress Controller to the appropriate services.
