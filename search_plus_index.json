Each VM should have a minimum of 2 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM. SSH access must be enabled on all nodes. All nodes should have network connectivity with each other. If you encounter errors during the creation process, these are often related to network connectivity or SSH access. Double-check your VM configurations and retry. Supported Operating Systems When creating a Kubernetes cluster with KubeKit, each virtual machine (VM) must run a supported operating system. You can attempt to create a cluster with an unsupported operating system, but KubeKit does not guarantee compatibility. In most cases, the cluster creation process will likely fail or result in unstable behavior. KubeKit supports the following operating systems for VM-based clusters: Ubuntu Debian Fedora CentOS RedHat Amazon Linux 2 Amazon Linux 2023 Each node in your cluster (control plane and worker) must have one of the above operating systems installed and properly configured before initiating cluster creation. Using a non-supported OS may cause compatibility issues with Kubernetes components, system dependencies, or network configurations. Recommendation: Always ensure that your VM images are up to date with the latest security patches and system packages before cluster deployment. Consistency in OS type and version across all nodes is also recommended for stable performance and easier maintenance. Tips for a Smooth Cluster Creation Ensure all nodes meet the minimum system requirements. Check network connectivity and SSH access to each node before starting. Use the latest Kubernetes version for optimal stability and features. If an error occurs during deployment, review the logs and verify node configurations.

It lets you define, install, and upgrade applications using pre-configured templates known as releases. Each release includes all the configuration and dependencies needed to run an application seamlessly within a cluster. In simple terms, Helm allows you to deploy applications on Kubernetes without manually handling complex YAML configuration files. Common applications like NGINX, Prometheus, and Grafana can be deployed easily using Helm. KubeKit enhances this experience by providing a graphical interface for Helm operations, eliminating the need for command-line commands. With just a few clicks, you can browse, configure, and install applications directly into your clusters. Before You Begin Before using Helm in KubeKit, ensure: You have at least one running cluster connected to KubeKit. Internet access is available to fetch Helm repositories and releases. Necessary permissions are configured to install applications on the target cluster. Accessing Helm in KubeKit Open the KubeKit Dashboard. From the left-hand menu, select Helm. The Helm page will display a list of available Helm releases. Loading time may vary depending on your internet connection and the number of repositories added. Browsing Helm Releases On the Helm page: The left panel shows all available releases. Each release card displays: Name of the release Repository it belongs to Short description of its function Selecting a release displays detailed information on the right panel, including: Available versions Full description and configurations Option to choose a version for installation Installing a Release Select a release from the list. Click Install to open the Release Installation Page. On this page, you can: Select a version of the release. Choose a namespace for deployment. Provide a custom name to identify the release later. Configuring Release Values In the right panel, you can view and modify the release’s configuration values. These values define the application’s behavior and resource usage. You can: Edit values directly. Search for specific parameters. Add or delete configuration entries. Reset to default values. Note: Configuration options vary between releases. Some applications have only a few settings, while others offer extensive customization. Once configuration is complete, click Install. KubeKit handles the deployment and will notify you when the installation finishes. Managing Installed Releases Click the Installed tab to view all deployed releases. You can filter releases by namespace or search by name. Selecting a release shows its details on the right panel: Custom name (if assigned) Release name and version Namespace App version and last updated time Current status (Deployed, Failed, Uninstalled, etc.) You can also view all associated Kubernetes resources, such as: ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding – define access permissions. ConfigMap – store configuration data. Deployment – manage stateless applications. StatefulSet – manage stateful workloads. DaemonSet – ensure pods run on specific nodes. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) – manage storage requests. Service – expose applications internally or externally. ServiceAccount – provide identities for pods. Viewing these components helps in understanding and troubleshooting the deployed release. Managing Release Lifecycle After installation, you can perform the following lifecycle actions on any release: Upgrade Upgrade a release to: Change its version Update configuration values Reuse current release values during upgrades Example: If you installed Prometheus and changed the scrape_interval from 1 minute to 30 seconds, enabling Reuse current release values keeps that configuration during upgrade. Rollback Each installation or upgrade creates a revision, a checkpoint of your release. You can roll back to any previous revision to restore the application’s last working state in case of issues. Uninstall Uninstalling removes the release from the cluster. By default, KubeKit keeps the release history for future rollbacks. You can uncheck Keep history for future rollback if you want to permanently delete it. Managing Repositories Helm’s ecosystem includes thousands of prebuilt releases organized within repositories. A Helm repository is a collection of application charts maintained by different providers. Viewing and Managing Repositories Go to Helm → Manage Repo. The repository management page shows: Repository name and URL Category Status (Added or Not Added) Popular repositories may appear as Not Added by default. You can: Click the ⋮ (three dots) menu next to a repository. Choose Add to include it or Remove to delete it. To update repositories, use: Update All to refresh every repository.

Each workload type supports searching, filtering, and management features such as deletion, scaling, and detailed inspection. Pods You can view all pods across all namespaces within the Cluster Dashboard. The pod list allows you to search and filter by namespace, node, or status to easily locate specific pods. For any pod, you have the option to delete it by selecting the pod, which will display a Delete button. Access pod terminal You can also access the terminal of a pod directly from the dashboard. To do this, navigate to the Workloads section and select Pods. On the Pods page, locate the pod you want to access and click the three-dot action menu on the far right of its row. From the menu, click the Terminal button to open a shell session into the container running inside that pod. This feature enables you to interact with the pod directly for troubleshooting, configuration, or monitoring purposes. Deployments You can search and filter deployments by namespace. Each deployment can be deleted or scaled as needed to adjust your application workload. Scaling Deployments Scaling a deployment means adjusting the number of running instances, or replicas, of a workload so that your cluster can respond appropriately to changing demand. Scaling up schedules additional pods onto nodes, enabling your application to handle increased load. Scaling down frees up resources and reduces unnecessary cost or overhead. In Kubernetes, a deployment manages pods through a replica set. Changing the replica count triggers the replica set controller to add or remove pods accordingly. For further reading on the native Kubernetes approach to scaling, see Kubernetes Scaling an Application and Kubernetes Autoscaling Workloads. Open the Deployments Page Navigate to the Deployments view under the Workload section in the sidebar of the KubeKit interface. This page displays all existing deployments across namespaces by default. Choose a Namespace (Optional) To focus on a single namespace, use the namespace-selector dropdown at the top-left of the page to filter the list. If no namespace is selected, deployments from all namespaces will be shown. Access the Deployment’s Action Menu Find the row corresponding to the deployment you wish to scale. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) at the end of the row to view available actions. Select the “Scale” Action From the action menu, choose Scale. A dialog window will open where you can specify the new replica count. Specify the Desired Number of Replicas The scale dialog will display the current number of replicas for reference. Enter the new desired count of replicas, for example increasing from 3 to 6. This defines how many pod instances the deployment should run moving forward. Apply the Change Click the Apply button to confirm your change. KubeKit will instruct Kubernetes to reconcile the deployment to the new replica count and update the underlying ReplicaSet accordingly. By following these steps, you can quickly and reliably scale any deployment using KubeKit’s UI, adapting your application footprint to match runtime conditions. Replica Sets Lists all ReplicaSets. Search or filter by namespace. Delete by selecting the desired ReplicaSet. View details by clicking on its name. Replication Controllers Functionality identical to ReplicaSets. Search, filter, delete, or inspect detailed configurations. Stateful Sets Lists all StatefulSets. Search or filter by namespace. Delete as required. Click to view configuration details. Jobs Displays all Kubernetes Jobs. Search or filter by namespace. Delete Jobs when necessary. Click to see more details. CronJobs Similar management features as Jobs. Search, filter, delete, or view details. Daemon Sets View, search, and filter by namespace. Delete or inspect a DaemonSet by clicking its name.

It acts as a set of routing rules that determine which service should handle requests based on: Domain name (e.g., api.example.com) URL path (e.g., example.com/app) Ingress can also manage HTTPS/TLS certificates to secure communication. For detailed official documentation, refer to the Kubernetes Ingress page: Kubernetes Ingress Documentation Ingress Controller An Ingress Controller is the software that enforces Ingress rules. It runs inside the cluster and functions as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Its responsibilities include: Continuously watching Ingress resources Updating its configuration to ensure traffic is routed correctly Handling SSL/TLS termination Without an Ingress Controller, Ingress rules do not have any effect. Popular Ingress Controllers NGINX Ingress Controller Based on the NGINX web server Reliable, widely used, and production-ready Supports routing, SSL/TLS termination, and load balancing Official documentation: NGINX Ingress Controller Traefik Ingress Controller Modern, cloud-native proxy Developer-friendly and simple to configure Features automatic HTTPS and a built-in dashboard Official documentation: Traefik Ingress Controller Using Ingress in KubeKit When creating a cluster through KubeKit, you can enable an Ingress Controller: Choose an Ingress Controller: Select either NGINX or Traefik. Provide an external IP: This IP will be used for routing traffic. Once configured, your cluster is ready to route external traffic through the Ingress Controller to the appropriate services.
